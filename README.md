# Diabetes Prediction using Machine Learning 🏥
Binary classification model to predict diabetes using Logistic Regression and Random Forest.

## Problem ‼️
This project focuses on predicting diabetes diagnosis using clinical health data from the Pima Indians Diabetes dataset.

## Dataset 📊 
- Source: UCI Machine Learning Repository
- 768 samples
- 8 numerical features
- Binary classification target (0 = No diabetes, 1 = Diabetes)

## Data Preprocessing 🧹
- Detection of invalid zero values
- Median imputation
- Train-test split
- Feature scaling

## Models Tested 
- Logistic Regression (baseline model)
- Random Forest (ensemble model)

## Results 📈
Models were evaluated using accuracy and comparison of predictions.  
Final model performance achieved competitive classification results.

## Technologies 🛠
- Python
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Scikit-learn
- Matplotlib / Seaborn
